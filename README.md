## Weekly Checklists

### Week 1
For week one the general goal is to get the basic design of our robot done, while also sorting out all of our methods of communication and writing some basic movement code for the robot.
- [x] Decide on group meetings - week 1 meet 2 - 3 thursday.
- [ ] Decide how we will be programming our robot, or how it will get through the maze.
- [x] Gail: Start the prototype design for the chassis/robot.
- [x] Gus: Write the basic forward motion code.
- [x] Annisha: Write the basic turning code.
- [x] Jake: Get the GitHub repository up and running.
- [x] Annisha: Sort out the groups/chats for the team.
- Arthur said to not use ir sensors for the tape, use the camera?

### Week 2
By the end of week two we hope to have the design/chassis of the robot finished, then our group can start (at the end of the week/start of week 3) testing the robot with the code we have been writing. 
- [ ] Annisha: Debug the existing code/improve it.
- [x] Gail: Finish the robot design/chassis.
- [ ] Gus: Write code for moving using sensors.
- [x] Jake: Write code for moving using camera.
- [ ] Mal: Write turning movement code.

### Week 2 Completed Tasks
- Chassis done for the most part - just need a wheel/support at the back. Gail will aim to finish the design by Sunday, and get printing on Monday.
- Jake made a start on the code for the movement of the motors. The robot can turn its motors depending on the picture taken by the camera. Aim to test this out properly on the maze once we finish the physical construction of the robot.

### Week 3
By the end of week three, we hope to have all bugs fixed with the physical running of the robot, while still working on writing the code for the robot/debugging the code.
- [ ] Annisha: Test the code for straight/maybe turning functions of robot while on maze.
- [ ] Gail: Finish construction of robot
- [ ] Gus: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Jake: Write code to communicate with the door.
- [ ] Mal: Begin integrating sensor and movement code.
- [ ] Begin implementation of PID

### Week 4
The AVC progress report is due on Monday the 22nd, at start of week 4. By the end of week 4 we want to have quadrants 1 and 2 completed.
- [ ] Annisha: Test robot/coding.
- [ ] Gail: Make any improvemnts to robots design after tests/code.
- [ ] Gus: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Jake: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Mal: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.

### Week 5
By the end of week 5 we want to have quadrant 3 complete. By now, all of us will be working on the code and regularly testing our robot.
- [ ] Annisha: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Gail: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Gus: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Jake: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Mal: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.

### Week 6
By the end of week 6 we want to have quadrant 4 complete, and to be able to run through the course with no hiccups, as this will be the last week.
- [ ] Annisha: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Gail: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Gus: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Jake: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Mal: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
