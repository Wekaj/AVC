## Weekly Checklists

### Week 1
For week one the general goal is to get the basic design of our robot done, while also sorting out all of our methods of communication and writing some basic movement code for the robot.
- [ ] Decide on group meetings - week 1 meet 2 - 3 thursday.
- [ ] Decide how we will be programming our robot, or how it will get through the maze.
- [ ] Gail: Start the prototype design for the chassis/robot.
- [ ] Gus: Write the basic forward motion code.
- [ ] Annisha: Write the basic turning code.
- [ ] Jake: Get the GitHub repository up and running.
- [ ] Annisha: Sort out the groups/chats for the team.
- [ ] arthur said to not use ir sensors for the tape, use the camera?

### Week 2
By the end of week two we hope to have the design/chassis of the robot finished, then our group can start (at the end of the week/start of week 3) testing the robot with the code we have been writing. 
- [ ] Annisha: Write code for moving using sensors.
- [ ] Gail: Finish the robot design/chassis.
- [ ] Gus: Write code for moving using sensors.
- [ ] Jake: Write code for moving using sensors.
- [ ] Mel: Write basic code for the opening of the door.

### Week 3
By the end of week three, we hope to have all bugs fixed with the physical running of the robot, while still working on writing the code for the robot/debugging the code.
- [ ] Annisha: Test the code for straight/maybe turning functions of robot.
- [ ] Gail: Debug the robots bugs???
- [ ] Gus: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Jake: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Mel: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.

### Week 4
The AVC progress report is due on Monday the 22nd, at start of week 4. By the end of week 4 we want to have quadrants 1 and 2 completed.
- [ ] Annisha: Test robot/coding.
- [ ] Gail: Make any improvemnts to robots design after tests/code.
- [ ] Gus: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Jake: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
- [ ] Mel: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.

### Week 5
By the end of week 5 we want to have quadrant 3 complete. By now, all of us will be working on the code and regularly testing our robot.
- [ ] Annisha: Debug the code we have and continue writing code.
