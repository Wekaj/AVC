- [ ] Decide how we will be programming our robot, or how it will get through the maze.

- [ ] Gail: Start the prototype design for the chassis/robot.
- [ ] Gus: Write the basic forward motion code.
- [ ] Annisha: Write the basic turning code.
- [ ] Jake: Get the GitHub repository up and running.
- [ ] Annisha: Sort out the groups/chats for the team.
- [ ] arthur said to not use ir sensors for the tape, use the camera?

## Week 2 Checklist
By the end of week two we hope to have the design/chassis of the robot finished, then our group can start(at the end of the week/start of nweek 3) testing the robot with the code we have been writing. 
- [ ] Annisha : write code for moving using sensors
- [ ] Gail : by end of week finish robot design/chassy
- [ ] Gus : write code for moving using sensors
- [ ] Jake : write code for moving using sensors
- [ ] Mel : write basic code/code for the opening of the door
## Week 3 Checklist
By the end of week three, we hope to have all bugs fixed with the physical running of the robot, whule still working on writing the code for the robot/debugging the code
- [ ] Annisha : test code for stright/maybe turining functions of robot
- [ ] Gail : debug the robots bugs???
- [ ] Gus : debug code we have and continue writing code
- [ ] Jake : debug code we have and continue writing code
- [ ] Mel : debug code we have and continue writing code
## Week 4 Checklist
AVC progress report due on monday the 22nd, start of week 4. by the end of week 4 we want to have quandrant one and 2 complete.
- [ ] Annisha : test robot/codeing
- [ ] Gail : any imporvemnts to robots design after tests/code
- [ ] Gus : debug code we have and continue writing code
- [ ] Jake : debug code we have and continue writing code
- [ ] Mel : debug code we have and continue writing code
## Week 5 Checklist
By the end of week 4 we want to have quandrant 3 complete, by now al of us will be working on the code and regulary testing our robot.
- [ ] Annisha : debug code we have and continue writing code
- [ ] Gail : debug code we have and continue writing code

Team Agreement
By signing below, all team members are acknowledging that they have read and
committed to their part in the AVC. They acknowledge that they will attempt
to complete the tasks agreed on by the group each week and document this on
the team github account. They acknowledge that failure to meet these goals
can result in the team recommending any member receives a lesser grade for
their AVC report. In the event that a team member is unable to complete their
task due to circumstances beyond their control (i.e. sickness, bereavement etc)
that they will inform the team at the earliest possible time. Finally, the team
acknowledges that a member going a week without contact with other team
members (except when discussed with the team in advance) will constitute the
member in question being considered AWOL. In this instance the team agrees
to inform the ENGR101 course co-ordinator immediately. The penalty this for
this can range from a reduction in the final grade to immediate failure of the
AVC (and thus the ENGR101 course). Should the team unanimously agree that
a member (or members) have failed to contribute to the AVC sufficiently for
other reasons, on the day of robot testing the team will be given the opportunity
to anonymously vote for a team member to receive 0% for the robot part of the
AVC. Should the team choose this option they MUST be able to show that the
member in question had been assigned tasks that they failed to complete and
that the team had afforded them an opportunity to make up for past mistakes.
